            <h2>Run the Messier Marathon</h2>

            <p>It's time for the annual <span class="importantNames">Messier Marathon</span>. Instead of lacing up their
                Nikes, amateur astronomers will be
                hauling
                telescopes, star charts, and a hefty pot of coffee in an all-night vigil hunting the Messier objects.
            </p>

            <p>Messier objects are stellar objects, classified by astronomer <span class="importantNames">Charles
                    Messier</span> in the
                18th
                century, ranging from
                distant galaxies to star clusters to stellar nebula. March is the only month in the year in which all
                110
                Messier
                objects are in the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see all of them, you have to start looking right
                after
                sunset and continue until just before sunrise - hence the term,
                "marathon."
                Ironically, <span class="importantNames">Charles
                    Messier</span> wasn't all that interested in his objects. He made the list in order to
                avoid
                seeing
                them.
                Messier was more interested in discovering new comets and these beautiful stellar objects were often
                mistaken
                for
                comets
                before Messier made his list.</p>
